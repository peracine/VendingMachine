## Instructions
As a starting point for a technical interview, we will use an assignment. 

Please find attached an assignment as part of our interview process. The instructions are very simple, just make the code beautiful.
- Adhere to the business requirements 
- Enable that code can be modified and changed by a community of professionals (team)
- Enable that the code can steadily create value

Keep in mind that there are no ‘right answers.’ This assignment is designed is to gauge your skills and give us an idea of how you approach tasks relevant to the role. It would be great if you could send this over to us by a week. If the timeline won’t agree with your current plans, just give us a holler. 

Hand in the thing using GitHub (or similar).
